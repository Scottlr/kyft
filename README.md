# Kyft

Kyft is a C# library for recording temporal state windows and comparing them
across sources, providers, or pipeline stages.

It is for systems where the important question is not only "what is the latest
value?", but:

- when was this state active?
- who observed it?
- who missed it?
- where did sources overlap, diverge, lag, or leave gaps?
- what was knowable at a specific point in time?

Kyft turns event predicates into recorded windows, then gives you a staged
comparison API for auditing those windows.

## Concrete Use Cases

- Compare two monitoring providers and find where one reported an outage that
  the other missed.
- Audit a detector or model decision using only the windows that were knowable
  at the decision point.
- Run live analysis over still-open windows and separate final rows from
  provisional rows.

## What Category Is This?

Kyft sits between event processing and analytics.

It is not a general stream processor, metrics library, or database abstraction.
It records the periods where a state was active, then compares those periods as
first-class temporal data.

The core flow is:

1. Define when a keyed state is active.
2. Ingest events.
3. Record open and closed windows.
4. Compare windows across sources or stages.
5. Export rows, summaries, diagnostics, and explanations.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Kyft # Add the core state-window recording and comparison package.
dotnet add package Kyft.Testing # Add optional helpers for fixtures, snapshots, and assertions.
```

`Kyft.Testing` is optional. It is useful in consumer test suites when you want
small comparison fixtures without running a full pipeline.

## First Example: Record Windows

Define the event shape, the key that owns state, and the predicate that says
when the window is active.

```csharp
using Kyft; // Import Kyft's pipeline and comparison APIs.

var pipeline = Kyft // Start a Kyft pipeline definition.
    .For<DeviceSignal>() // Configure the event type that will be ingested.
    .RecordIntervals() // Store opened and closed windows for comparison.
    .TrackWindow( // Define one state-driven window.
        "DeviceOffline", // Name the state span that will be recorded.
        key: signal => signal.DeviceId, // Track each device independently.
        isActive: signal => !signal.IsOnline); // Open the window while the device is offline.

pipeline.Ingest(new DeviceSignal("device-1", IsOnline: false), source: "provider-a"); // Open provider A's window.
pipeline.Ingest(new DeviceSignal("device-1", IsOnline: true), source: "provider-a"); // Close provider A's window.
pipeline.Ingest(new DeviceSignal("device-1", IsOnline: false), source: "provider-b"); // Open provider B's window.
pipeline.Ingest(new DeviceSignal("device-1", IsOnline: true), source: "provider-b"); // Close provider B's window.

public sealed record DeviceSignal(string DeviceId, bool IsOnline); // Define the event shape.
```

`RecordIntervals()` is the important switch. It keeps the temporal evidence that
later comparisons, exports, and tests operate on.

## Compare Recorded Windows

Comparison is staged in the order an analyst usually asks the question:
baseline, comparison source, scope, normalization, metric.

```csharp
var result = pipeline.Intervals // Use the recorded window history.
    .Compare("Provider QA") // Name the comparison for reports and exports.
    .Target("provider-a", selector => selector.Source("provider-a")) // Treat provider A as the baseline.
    .Against("provider-b", selector => selector.Source("provider-b")) // Compare provider B against it.
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("DeviceOffline")) // Limit the question to one window family.
    .Using(comparators => comparators // Choose the row sets to emit.
        .Overlap() // Emit rows where both sources agreed the state was active.
        .Residual() // Emit provider-A-only rows.
        .Missing() // Emit provider-B-only rows.
        .Coverage()) // Emit magnitude and coverage summaries.
    .Run(); // Execute the historical comparison.

foreach (var row in result.ResidualRows) // Inspect target-only rows.
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{row.WindowName} {row.Key} missed from {row.Range.Start} to {row.Range.End}"); // Print each missed segment.
}
```

The result is structured data:

- diagnostics
- selected, excluded, and normalized windows
- aligned temporal segments
- comparator rows
- summaries
- finality metadata
- deterministic JSON, JSON Lines, Markdown, and debug HTML exports

For visual debugging, export the result as a standalone HTML artifact:

```csharp
result.ExportDebugHtml("artifacts/provider-qa.html"); // Write a browser-readable timeline and segment graph.
```

You can also make debug output a configuration-driven execution option:

```csharp
var debugHtml = ComparisonDebugHtmlOptions.ToFile("artifacts/provider-qa.html"); // Enable a visual artifact for this run.
var comparison = pipeline.Intervals // Start from recorded windows.
    .Compare("Provider QA") // Name the comparison.
    .Target("provider-a", selector => selector.Source("provider-a")) // Select the target source.
    .Against("provider-b", selector => selector.Source("provider-b")) // Select the comparison source.
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("DeviceOffline")) // Limit analysis to one window family.
    .Using(comparators => comparators.Overlap().Residual()); // Request agreement and target-only rows.
var resultWithDebug = comparison.Run(debugHtml); // Execute and write the debug file.
```

The debug HTML file is useful when you need to see why a comparison produced a
row: which source window was active, where the overlap started, where a gap
appeared, and whether live rows are still provisional.

## Query Recorded Windows Directly

Use direct history queries when you need to inspect one lane or key without
building a comparison plan.

```csharp
var windows = pipeline.Intervals.Query() // Start a read-only query over recorded windows.
    .Window("DeviceOffline") // Restrict the query to one window family.
    .Key("device-1") // Restrict the query to one logical key.
    .Lane("provider-a") // Restrict the query to one lane, stored as Source.
    .Segment("lifecycle", "Incident") // Require an analytical segment value.
    .Tag("fleet", "critical") // Require descriptive metadata.
    .ClosedWindows(); // Materialize matching closed windows.

var latest = pipeline.Intervals.Query() // Start another recorded-history query.
    .Window("DeviceOffline") // Query one window family.
    .Lane("provider-a") // Query one lane.
    .LatestWindow(); // Return the latest matching open or closed window.
```

For a live read model without cross-source comparison, create a snapshot at an
explicit horizon:

```csharp
var snapshot = pipeline.Intervals.SnapshotAt(TemporalPoint.ForPosition(100)); // Evaluate history at position 100.
var open = snapshot.Query() // Query the horizon snapshot.
    .Window("DeviceOffline") // Inspect one window family.
    .Lane("provider-a") // Inspect one lane.
    .OpenWindows(); // Return records active at the horizon.

var openQuickCheck = pipeline.Intervals.Query() // Start from the recorded history.
    .Window("DeviceOffline") // Restrict the query to one window family.
    .Lane("provider-a") // Restrict the query to one lane.
    .OpenWindowsAt(TemporalPoint.ForPosition(100)); // Return records active at position 100.

var byLifecycle = snapshot.Query() // Reuse the same horizon snapshot.
    .Window("DeviceOffline") // Keep the summary scoped to one window family.
    .Windows() // Materialize final and provisional records.
    .SummarizeBySegment("lifecycle"); // Group counts and measured length by lifecycle.

var annotation = pipeline.Intervals.Annotate( // Attach metadata discovered after the window opened.
    latest!, // Annotate the latest matching source window.
    "reason", // Name the annotation.
    "maintenance", // Store the explanatory value.
    TemporalPoint.ForPosition(105)); // Record when the annotation became known.

var knownAnnotations = pipeline.Intervals.AnnotationsKnownAt( // Read point-in-time-safe annotations.
    latest!, // Use the same source window.
    TemporalPoint.ForPosition(110)); // Include annotations known by position 110.
```

## What Makes Kyft Different?

Kyft's main primitive is not an event, metric, or table row. It is a recorded
state window with comparison semantics.

That gives you:

- explicit open and closed windows
- source-aware comparison
- half-open temporal ranges
- overlap, residual, missing, coverage, gap, containment, lead/lag, and as-of
  comparators
- known-at filtering for point-in-time safety
- live horizons for ongoing windows
- deterministic explanations and exports

## Why Not Just X?

### Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is good for storing durable facts and rebuilding state. Kyft is
for analyzing the periods where state was active after those facts have been
interpreted.

Use event sourcing to preserve the facts. Use Kyft when you need to compare
"provider A thought this device was offline from 10 to 20" against "provider B
thought it was offline from 12 to 18".

### Stream Processors

Stream processors are good for online computation, routing, enrichment, and
continuous aggregation. Kyft is smaller and more focused: it records state
windows and compares them.

Use a stream processor to run a distributed pipeline. Use Kyft when your C#
code needs an inspectable temporal comparison artifact.

### Observability And Metrics Tools

Metrics tools are good for dashboards, counters, histograms, and alerts. They
usually compress time into aggregates.

Kyft keeps the individual windows and emits comparison rows. That matters when
you need to answer "which exact interval was missed?" rather than "what was the
average error rate?"

### Storing Intervals Directly In A Database

A database can store intervals, but it will not give you Kyft's comparison
model by itself: staged plans, source selectors, normalization, live finality,
known-at filtering, diagnostics, and deterministic exports.

Use the database for persistence. Use Kyft to define and execute the temporal
comparison logic.

## Comparator Families

- `Overlap()` shows agreement.
- `Residual()` shows target-only duration.
- `Missing()` shows comparison-only duration.
- `Coverage()` shows magnitude and coverage summaries.
- `Gap()` shows empty spaces inside an observed scope.
- `SymmetricDifference()` shows disagreement in both directions.
- `Containment()` checks whether one state stays inside another state.
- `LeadLag(...)` measures transition timing drift.
- `AsOf(...)` performs point-in-time lookup without future leakage.

See [Comparator reference](docs/comparator-reference.md) for row shapes and
details.

## Live Windows

Historical comparisons reject open windows by default. Live comparisons require
an explicit horizon and mark rows that depend on open windows as provisional.

```csharp
var live = pipeline.Intervals // Use the current recorded history.
    .Compare("Live provider QA") // Name the live comparison.
    .Target("provider-a", selector => selector.Source("provider-a")) // Keep provider A as baseline.
    .Against("provider-b", selector => selector.Source("provider-b")) // Compare provider B against it.
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("DeviceOffline")) // Analyze one window family.
    .Using(comparators => comparators.Residual()) // Ask for baseline-only duration.
    .RunLive(TemporalPoint.ForPosition(100)); // Clip open windows to position 100.

foreach (var finality in live.ProvisionalRowFinalities()) // Inspect rows that may change later.
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{finality.RowId} is provisional: {finality.Reason}"); // Explain why the row is provisional.
}

live.ExportDebugHtml("artifacts/live-provider-qa.html"); // Capture the current live window graph for debugging.
```

The same plan converges with batch execution when all source windows close.

## Lane Liveness And Silence

Use `LaneLivenessTracker` when sparse reporting should become normal Kyft
windows. The tracker emits state-change events from explicit observations and
horizon checks; it does not run timers or own distributed heartbeat monitoring.

```csharp
var startedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow; // Choose when liveness tracking starts.
var liveness = LaneLivenessTracker.ForLanes( // Create deterministic liveness state.
    startedAt, // Set the start timestamp.
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), // Mark a lane silent after 30 seconds without reports.
    "provider-a", // Track provider A.
    "provider-b"); // Track provider B.

var silencePipeline = Kyft // Build a normal Kyft pipeline for liveness events.
    .For<LaneLivenessSignal>() // Consume liveness state-change events.
    .RecordIntervals() // Record silence windows.
    .WithEventTime(signal => signal.OccurredAt) // Use the actual silence/recovery time.
    .TrackWindow("LaneSilent", window => window // Record one silence window family.
        .Key(signal => signal.Lane) // Track each lane independently.
        .ActiveWhen(signal => signal.IsSilent)); // Open while the lane is silent.

foreach (var signal in liveness.Observe("provider-a", startedAt)) // Record a provider A observation.
{
    silencePipeline.Ingest(signal, source: "liveness"); // Feed state changes into Kyft.
}

foreach (var signal in liveness.Check(startedAt.AddSeconds(45))) // Evaluate silence at a horizon.
{
    silencePipeline.Ingest(signal, source: "liveness"); // Open silence windows for expired lanes.
}
```

## Boundary Segments

Use segments when a value should split an active window while the state remains
active. This records the analytical shape during ingestion instead of slicing
windows later.

```csharp
var pipeline = Kyft // Start a Kyft pipeline definition.
    .For<DeviceStateChanged>() // Configure the event type that will be ingested.
    .RecordIntervals() // Store open and closed windows for comparison.
    .Window("DeviceOffline", window => window // Define one device-state window.
        .Key(update => update.DeviceId) // Track each device independently.
        .ActiveWhen(update => update.IsOffline) // Keep the window open while the device is offline.
        .Segment("lifecycle", lifecycle => lifecycle // Split when the operating lifecycle changes.
            .Value(update => update.Lifecycle) // Attach the current lifecycle value.
            .Child("stage", stage => stage // Nest stage under lifecycle.
                .Value(update => update.Stage))) // Split again when the stage changes.
        .Tag("fleet", update => update.FleetId)) // Attach metadata without splitting.
    .RollUp( // Roll device windows up to their zone.
        "ZoneOffline", // Name the parent window.
        update => update.ZoneId, // Group devices by zone.
        children => children.ActiveCount > 0, // A zone is offline when any device is offline.
        segments => segments // Keep only the dimensions useful at zone level.
            .Preserve("lifecycle") // Keep lifecycle boundaries.
            .Preserve("stage")) // Keep nested stage boundaries.
    .Build(); // Build the pipeline.

public sealed record DeviceStateChanged( // Define the event shape.
    string DeviceId, // Device identity.
    string ZoneId, // Parent zone identity.
    bool IsOffline, // Whether the device is currently offline.
    string Lifecycle, // Normal, maintenance, incident, or another lifecycle.
    string? Stage, // Stage inside the lifecycle, when any.
    string FleetId); // Descriptive metadata.
```

If `Lifecycle` changes while `IsOffline` is still true, Kyft closes the old
window and opens the new one at the same position. Ranges stay half-open, so
there is no gap or overlap.

Roll-ups preserve segment context by default, so device windows can roll up to
zone and region windows without merging lifecycle evidence. Segment projection
lets a parent intentionally keep, drop, rename, or transform child dimensions:

```csharp
.RollUp( // Roll device windows up to their zone.
    "ZoneOffline", // Name the parent window.
    update => update.ZoneId, // Group devices by zone.
    children => children.ActiveCount > 0, // A zone is offline when any device is offline.
    segments => segments // Shape the parent segment context.
        .Preserve("lifecycle") // Keep lifecycle on the parent.
        .Drop("stage") // Ignore lower-level stage changes at zone level.
        .Rename("lifecycle", "operatingMode") // Emit the parent dimension under a clearer name.
        .Transform("lifecycle", value => value?.ToString()?.ToUpperInvariant())) // Normalize values.
```

## Cohort Comparison

Use cohorts when the comparison side is a group rather than one source. An
any-member cohort is active whenever at least one declared member source is
active. `All()` and `AtLeast(n)` let you ask stricter consensus questions.

```csharp
var unmatched = pipeline.Intervals // Start from recorded segmented windows.
    .Compare("Source A unmatched during escalation") // Name the comparison.
    .Target("source-a", selector => selector.Source("source-a")) // Treat source A as the target.
    .AgainstCohort("cohort", cohort => cohort // Compare against the whole cohort.
        .Sources("source-b", "source-c", "source-d") // Include these member sources.
        .Activity(CohortActivity.Any())) // Any active member covers the cohort.
    .Within(scope => scope // Restrict the analytical question.
        .Window("DeviceOffline") // Use device-offline windows.
        .Segment("lifecycle", "Incident") // Only incident lifecycle windows.
        .Segment("stage", "Escalated") // Only escalated incident windows.
        .Tag("fleet", "critical")) // Only critical-fleet windows.
    .Using(comparators => comparators.Residual()) // Emit target-only rows against the cohort.
    .Run(); // Execute the comparison.

var total = unmatched.ResidualRows.TotalPositionLength(); // Sum unmatched processing-position length.

var evidence = unmatched.CohortEvidence(); // Parse cohort evidence into typed records.
var inactive = evidence.Where(row => !row.IsActive); // Inspect segments the cohort did not cover.
```

Kyft emits compact cohort evidence metadata for each aligned segment, including
the rule, required active count, actual active count, and whether the cohort was
active. `CohortEvidence()` turns that metadata into typed records for code, and
JSON, Markdown, and debug HTML exports include the same evidence for humans.

## Known-At Safety

Use `KnownAtPosition(...)` when a backtest, replay, or audit must only use
windows that were available at a decision point.

```csharp
var audit = pipeline.Intervals // Start from recorded windows.
    .Compare("Decision audit") // Name the point-in-time audit.
    .Target("detector", selector => selector.Source("detector")) // Treat detector output as the target.
    .Against("monitor", selector => selector.Source("monitor")) // Compare monitor history against it.
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("DeviceOffline")) // Audit the device-offline state.
    .Normalize(normalization => normalization.KnownAtPosition(42)) // Exclude records unavailable at position 42.
    .Using(comparators => comparators.AsOf( // Use a point-in-time lookup comparator.
        AsOfDirection.Previous, // Only match records known before the target point.
        TemporalAxis.ProcessingPosition, // Measure distance on processing positions.
        toleranceMagnitude: 10)) // Reject matches more than 10 positions away.
    .Run(); // Execute the leakage-safe audit.
```

Known-at is availability time. It is separate from event time.

## Testing And Fixtures

Use `Kyft.Testing` when a test needs a compact comparison history.

```csharp
using Kyft.Testing; // Import fixture and assertion helpers.

var history = new WindowHistoryFixtureBuilder() // Create a compact recorded history.
    .AddClosedWindow( // Add provider A's segmented window.
        "DeviceOffline", // Use the same window name a pipeline would record.
        "device-1", // Set the logical key.
        1, // Start at processing position 1.
        5, // End before processing position 5.
        window => window // Configure window metadata.
            .Source("provider-a") // Attach the source identity.
            .Segment("lifecycle", "Incident") // Attach a boundary segment.
            .Tag("fleet", "critical")) // Attach a descriptive tag.
    .AddClosedWindow("DeviceOffline", "device-1", 3, 7, source: "provider-b") // Add provider B's window.
    .Build(); // Build a WindowIntervalHistory.

var result = history.Compare("Fixture QA") // Create a fixture comparison.
    .Target("provider-a", selector => selector.Source("provider-a")) // Select provider A as target.
    .Against("provider-b", selector => selector.Source("provider-b")) // Select provider B as comparison.
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("DeviceOffline")) // Limit the fixture to one window family.
    .Using(comparators => comparators.Overlap()) // Emit agreement rows.
    .Run(); // Execute the comparison.

KyftAssert.IsValid(result); // Fail the test if Kyft produced error diagnostics.
```
