# Spanfold

**Temporal interval comparison for application state.**

When a predicate changes — a service goes down, a threshold is crossed, a status flips — Spanfold records that period as a window. When you have multiple sources reporting the same condition, Spanfold tells you exactly where they agreed, diverged, lagged, or left gaps.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Spanfold
```

## Quick Start

```csharp
// 1. Define: what condition are you tracking, and for which key?
var pipeline = Spanfold.Spanfold
    .For<MonitorEvent>()
    .RecordWindows()
    .TrackWindow("Outage",
        key:       e => e.ServiceId,
        predicate: e => e.Status == "down");

// 2. Ingest events from each source
pipeline.Ingest(providerAEvents, source: "provider-a");
pipeline.Ingest(providerBEvents, source: "provider-b");

// 3. Compare: who saw what, when, and for how long?
var result = pipeline.History
    .Compare("Outage audit")
    .Target("provider-a", s => s.Source("provider-a"))
    .Against("provider-b", s => s.Source("provider-b"))
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("Outage"))
    .Using(c => c.Overlap().Residual().Missing().Coverage())
    .Run();

// result.OverlapRows   — periods both sources agreed on
// result.ResidualRows  — periods A reported that B missed
// result.MissingRows   — periods B reported that A missed
```

## What It Solves

You have multiple systems — monitoring providers, pipeline stages, model versions, detectors — all reporting observations about the same thing. You want to know:

- **When** did each source think this condition was true, and for how long?
- **Where** did sources agree, diverge, lag, or leave gaps?
- **What** was knowable at a specific point in time, without leaking future data?

A latest-value store tells you the current state. An event log tells you what happened. Spanfold tells you **when each source believed what, and where those beliefs differed**.

## Why Not SQL Interval Joins or Ad Hoc Code?

Interval comparison looks simple until you account for partial overlaps, gaps within coverage, multiple windows on the same key, lead/lag timing, live windows, and known-at filtering. Each question adds another query or another special case.

**SQL interval join — overlap only:**

```sql
SELECT a.service_id,
       GREATEST(a.start, b.start) AS overlap_start,
       LEAST(a.end,   b.end)   AS overlap_end
FROM   outage_windows_a a
JOIN   outage_windows_b b
  ON   a.service_id = b.service_id
 AND   a.start < b.end
 AND   a.end   > b.start
-- Residual (A-only) needs a NOT EXISTS query.
-- Gap detection, lead/lag, coverage % each need another query.
-- Known-at filtering (no future leakage) needs timestamp join bookkeeping.
-- Live/provisional windows need finality state tracked separately.
```

**Spanfold — all of the above in one comparison plan:**

```csharp
var result = pipeline.History
    .Compare("Outage audit")
    .Target("provider-a", s => s.Source("provider-a"))
    .Against("provider-b", s => s.Source("provider-b"))
    .Within(scope => scope.Window("Outage"))
    .Using(c => c
        .Overlap()   // both agreed
        .Residual()  // A saw, B missed
        .Missing()   // B saw, A missed
        .Gap()       // empty periods inside observed scope
        .LeadLag()   // transition timing drift between sources
        .Coverage()) // magnitude and coverage percentage
    .Run();
// Known-at filtering and live horizons are built into the comparison model.
```

## Predicates Are Not Limited To Booleans

A window opens when a predicate changes. The predicate can evaluate anything — the window tracks the period it held.

| Predicate type   | Example                                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Boolean          | `isUp == true`                                    |
| Threshold        | `cpuPercent > 80`                                 |
| Enum / status    | `status == "degraded"`                            |
| Numeric range    | `latencyMs >= 500 && latencyMs < 2000`            |
| Any value change | alert level changed, model output changed, annotation updated |

## Comparator Families

| Comparator     | What it measures                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Overlap        | Duration where both sides agreed                       |
| Residual       | Target-only duration (what the comparison side missed) |
| Missing        | Comparison-only duration (what the target missed)      |
| Coverage       | Magnitude and coverage percentage                      |
| Gap            | Empty spaces inside an observed scope                  |
| Symmetric diff | Disagreement in both directions                        |
| Containment    | Whether one period stays inside another                |
| Lead / Lag     | Transition timing drift between sources                |
| As-of          | Point-in-time lookup without future leakage            |

## Use Cases

### Monitoring provider outage comparison

You have two or more monitoring providers watching the same service. When an outage occurs, each provider may report it at a slightly different time, recover at a different time, or miss it entirely. Spanfold records each provider's outage windows and emits structured rows showing exactly where they agreed, where one reported a period the other didn't, and how large each discrepancy was.

→ [Provider outage comparison](docs/use-cases.html#provider-outage-comparison)

### Pipeline stage divergence

A processing pipeline passes events through multiple stages — ingestion, enrichment, classification, alerting. When a condition appears at one stage but not another, or arrives late, or disappears before the final stage, Spanfold records a window at each stage and compares them to show where state diverged, lagged, or dropped.

→ [Pipeline stage divergence](docs/use-cases.html#pipeline-stage-divergence)

### Backtesting without future leakage

Auditing a past decision means using only what was knowable at the time — not data that arrived later. Spanfold's known-at filtering separates when a state was observed from when it was available to the system, so backtests, replays, and decision-point audits do not accidentally include future observations even when replaying historical data.

→ [No-future-leakage backtesting](docs/use-cases.html#backtesting)

## Core Concepts

**Windows** — a half-open period where a predicate held for a key. Can be closed, still open, or clipped to a live horizon.

**Sources and lanes** — where an observation came from: providers, monitors, gateways, pipeline stages, model versions, or any other reporting lane.

**Segments and tags** — segments split a window when analytical context changes; tags attach metadata without splitting.

**Comparisons** — a staged plan: target side, comparison side, scope, normalization, and comparator families. Produces structured temporal evidence.

**Known-at safety** — separates when a state happened from when it was observable. Prevents future leakage in backtests and replays.

**Live horizons** — an explicit cutoff for evaluating still-open windows. Preserves provisional row metadata so live and final rows are distinguishable.

---

## Why Not Just X?

**Latest-state tracking** — answers what is true now. Spanfold answers when it was true, who saw it, and whether another lane missed it.

**Event sourcing** — stores durable facts and rebuilds state. Spanfold analyzes the periods where that state held after those facts have been interpreted.

**Stream processors** — handle online computation, routing, enrichment, and aggregation. Spanfold is narrower: it records interpreted state windows and compares their temporal evidence.

**Observability and metrics tools** — aggregate time into counters, histograms, and dashboards. Spanfold keeps individual windows and emits comparison rows with full temporal structure.

**A database with interval storage** — can persist windows, but will not provide staged comparison plans, normalization, live finality, known-at filtering, diagnostics, or deterministic exports.
